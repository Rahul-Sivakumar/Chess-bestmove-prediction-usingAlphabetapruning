# Chess-bestmove-prediction-usingAlphabetapruning
This application is programmed using Python3.0. It recognizes each of the pieces using the number of black and white pixels and feeds this information as input into the stockfish module.
Which in turn uses Alphabeta pruning to determine the top 5 plausible movews and even provides its own model of the chess board with the best move highlighted.
